# Awesome books project
This project is based on previous Awesome books project but in this project new ES6 syntax has been used.
And in this project you can add or remove book from the list. And also if you make a mistake in writing name of your book, you can edit the name of the book. Last but not least, there is night mode version  if you prefer dark colors.
